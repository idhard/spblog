Once upon a time a logistics company called Roma, in the beginning, it operated with local customers offering an excellent delivery service. Having a distribution center located in the town made them highly efficient at delivering, but It wasn't the case for nearby towns, gravel roads hampered the transportation of goods. In consequence, Roma's CEO decided to start developing the required infrastructure to connect the towns.

He soon realized that everyone could benefit from the newly created roads but in order to cover the maintenance cost and expansion of the network he applied the following rules:

- Bicycles are for free as they do not take much of the space in the road
- Cars will pay a small fee because they take one line on the road
- Lorry will have to pay 2 times what a car pays

Everyone was happy to enjoy the new roads and the possibility of exploring the towns in the connected network of Roma's roads.

>"The world's oldest known paved road was constructed in Egypt sometime between 2600 and 2200 BC.[19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road#cite_note-19)"

Years passed by and Roma kept expanding its road network through all the country, continent and eventually becoming a globalized company with roads all over the world. They did what they do the best: ***delivering***

The Roma's success looks like an appealing history, right? but bear with me while we go through some important facts.

Roma owning the roads allow them to control the traffic of the network, apply censorship, banning users, sell the information they collect of the road to other companies and much more. A considerable amount of power to be handled on private hands in a service essential to the citizens. 
When a service became essential for the citizens it should be of public ownership, this has been the case for almost all essential utilities (roads, electricity, water, etc) to ensure universal availability,  security, and privacy for users. 

>â€œRoads are generally built and maintained by the public sector using taxation although implementation may be through private contractors). or occasionally using road tolls."


Now let's imagine that instead of roads Roma is creating a computer network over the Internet to deliver their products online letting everyone to use it. Like with roads they could apply the same traffic rules, after all, both share the same principle: delivery content.

Nowadays this is one of the biggest threat for citizen's rights, luckily for us, the governments seems to be aware of it and some exciting initiatives have been created

Now is time for us to answer these questions

- Who should own the roads?
- What happens if Roma changes its policy rules?
- How could we ensure nobody else knows who and where we are using their roads?
- How much the public sector spend on private cloud services?
